Generate FIR filter coefficients. 

Example usage: 

```python
py LpFilters.py 4 1 8
```

where Fs = 4, cutoff = 1, and # taps = 8 will generate LPF coefficients for FIR and moving average.

May need to install dependencies:

```python
pip install scipy
pip install sys
pip install pylab
```
